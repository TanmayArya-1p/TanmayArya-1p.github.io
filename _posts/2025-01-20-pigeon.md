*Submission for Makers SDS*


I was recently learning about how notifications work for [another project](https://github.com/TanmayArya-1p/CPsched) i was working on and i discovered that there are little to none free,open source solutions to schedule notfications in bulk. So i decided to create a service that makes this easier using webhooks.

#### Pigeon is a self hostable service that lets you do the following things:
- Schedule push notifications in bulk
- Create template Notifications and Dispatch them through you backend via a simple webhook


Pigeon is built on top of [ExpoPushMessaging](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/) for a few straight forward reasons:
- `ExponentPushTokens` unlike `FCM(FirebaseCloudMessaging)` tokens do not expire and is fixed for a device and installation instance.
- `ExponentPushTokens` can be used for both IOS and Android Push Messaging

#### Pigeon sits between your backend and ExpoPushMessaging Servers

## The Pigeon Stack Consists of 3 Micro-services

<img src="/assets/img/dg2.jpg" alt="dg2" style="">


1. **Dispatcher**
    - The Dispatcher is responsible for queuing notifications and sending them when their `scheduled_at` time is reached. A REST-API interface allows to append new orders and start/stop the dispatcher.
    - The Orders are stored in a redis database for fast CRUD operations
    - If any expired `ExponentPushToken` is found then a post request is sent to the `DELETE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN_URL` configured in the `.env` file
    - The need for concurrency here made me choose golang for this application

2. **Schema Engine**
    - The Schema Engine is responsible for creating,dispatching and processing templates.
    - Each template is defined by what i call `TemplateText` where the stuff mentioned within `{}` - curly braces is considered a parameter which can be replaced by a user defined string sent via the body in a POST request to the Schema Engine. When a template is dispatched, it interfaces with the Dispatcher to create new orders.
    - Templates are stored in a Supabase Postgres database and the REST-API is implemented with `fastapi`
3. **Webview**
    - The webview is simply just a ui to manage the schema engine and the dispatcher.
    - Allows for users to create templates,notifications and dispatch them to one or many targets. The Dipatcher can be toggled as well from this webview.
    - The Webview is built with `react-router`, `tailwindcss` and `vite` 



***The Schema Engine and the Dispatcher are meant to be deployed separately as their own separate services***

***Both the Schema Engine and the Dispatcher comes with its own Dockerfiles to allow for quick deployment. Alternatively the entire stack can be deployed with the docker [compose.yaml](https://github.com/TanmayArya-1p/Pigeon/blob/main/compose.yaml)***


# Demo:

Here i will demo only 2 of the core functionalities.
In this demo i used my device's Exponent Push Token from the ExpoGo app

1. Dispatching a Simple Notifications

2. Creating a Template and Dispatching an Order using it

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1048411311?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="vd2"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>



***Note that both these actions can be done programmatically via webhooks at `<dispatcher>/dispatch` and `<schema-engine>/dispatch/<schema-id>` respectively***


# Try it yourself

I've hosted all these services in my [raspberry-pi homelab](https://onetincan.tech/headq) through [Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)


| Dispatcher    | <a href="https://pigeon-dispatcher.onetincan.tech/status">pigeon-dispatcher.onetincan.tech<a> |
| Schema Engine    | <a href="https://pigeon-schema-engine.onetincan.tech/docs">pigeon-schema-engine.onetincan.tech<a> |
| Webview |  <a href="https://pigeon.onetincan.tech">pigeon.onetincan.tech<a>    |

*If any of these services are down and you would like to try them out just drop an email and ill deploy them*

***The Webview is especially very slow because of my cloudflare tunnel being throttled, use with patience and discretion***

***If you would like to try to build and deploy them yourself find the steps to do so down below***

# Telemetry

The `Dispatcher` can be linked with a Prometheus instance along with Grafana for telemetry. The Pigeon Dispatcher enables this by exporting metrics via the [`/metrics`](https://pigeon-dispatcher.onetincan.tech/metrics) path

#### Here is a Grafana Panel for [`pigeon-dispatcher.onetincan.tech`](pigeon-dispatcher.onetincan.tech)

# Deployment Steps


- **Clone the Repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TanmayArya-1p/Pigeon
    ```

- **Create .env Files**

    Create a `.env` file of the following format 
    ```
    SCHEMA_ENGINE_PORT=5000
    SCHEMA_ENGINE_AUTH_SECRET=nil
    SUPABASE_USER=postgres.mtcbvdyubwpysosyqsbt
    SUPABASE_PASSWORD=<lol>
    SUPABASE_HOST=aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com
    SUPABASE_PORT=6543

    REDIS_HOST=redis-11698.c305.ap-south-1-1.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:11698
    REDIS_PORT=11698
    REDIS_PASSWORD=<lol>    
    REDIS_CACHE_EXPIRE=1800
    DISPATCHER_AUTH_SECRET=nil
    DISPATCHER_PORT = 8000
    DELETE_TOKEN_WEBHOOK=blah
    ```
    and drop them in `Pigeon.SchemaEngine` and `Pigeon.Dispatcher` directories



- **Deploy Docker Containers**
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
- **Run the Webview**

    CD into `Pigeon.Webview` and configure the application in `app/config.json`

    - Install the required packages

    ```bash
    npm i --force
    ```

    - Build and Serve

    ```bash
    npm run build && npm run start
    ```
